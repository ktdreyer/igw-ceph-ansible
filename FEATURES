- confirms RHEL7.3 - and aborts if necessary
- ensures targetcli is installed (for rtslib support)
- creates rbd's if needed
- checks the size of the rbds at run time and expands if necessary
- maps the rbds to the host (gateway)
- maps these rbds to LIO
- creates an iscsi target - common iqn, and tpg
- adds a portal ip based on a given network CIDR
- adds all the mapped luns to the tpg (ready for client assignment)
- add clients to the gateways, with/without CHAP
- images mapped to clients can be added/removed by changing image_list and rerunning the playbook
- clients can be removed using the state=absent variable and rerunning the playbook. At this point the entry can be
  removed from the variables file
- configuration can be wiped with the purge_cluster playbook
- current state can be seen by looking at the configuration object (stored in the rbd pool)

Current State (from last ansible build) may be seen by looking at the
rbd/gateway.conf object ... json formatted 'file'
