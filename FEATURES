- confirms RHEL7.3 - and aborts if necessary
- ensures targetcli is installed (for rtslib support)
- creates rbd's if needed
- checks the size of the rbds at run time and expands if necessary
- maps the rbds to the host (gateway)
- maps all rbds to LIO
- creates an iscsi target - common iqn, and tpg
- adds a portal ip based on a given interface name to the tpg
- adds all the mapped luns to the tpg (ready for client assignment)
- add clients to the gateways, with/without CHAP
- images mapped to clients can be added/removed by rerunning ansible
- clients can be removed using the state=absent variable
