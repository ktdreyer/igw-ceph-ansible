Basic to-do list
----------------
check firewalld is enabled
update firewalld for lio (3260)
update firewalld for ceph


Module updates to-do
--------------------
update the command calls to use pvs_cmd = module.get_bin_path('pvs', True) format, to make it more portable
convert rbd calls in igw_lun to python rbd api (can't do mapping though!)
add a rebalance module to balance the active paths across multiple gateways
add a check to gateway to abort if the given nic/ip is already in use by an existing target that isn't the one we want to use
account for the deletion of the gateway.conf object - how to repopulate from the running config..?
add a igw-purge module and yml file to remove the config across gateway(s)


Completed Tasks
---------------
update code path to detect rbd or gluster as the platform and modify code path accordingly ... done
use ansible variables to abort tasks if not rhel 7.3 ... done
add a timeout and abort to igw_lun.py ... done
count the number of changes for the log summary ... done
handle the logfile - rotate at size ... done
add a disk size check to permit disk size increases by simply rerunning ansible ... done
switch to rados calls for config object (replacing rados cli calls) ... done
place Config class/methods in a separate module, so all custom modules interact with config in a standard manner ... done
provide an example playbook based on group_variables ... done
refactor lock/unlock code in Config class ... done
